== Sexy appenders

Note: 
- Originally extracted from magic_tracer since I viewed that they had some generic utility value which could be reused elsewhere.
- The magic_tracer was designed to output tracing logs to multiple channels. 

=== Formats
Sexy appenders let you target various formats and channels for any kind of logging output. 

=== Content wrappers
Each appender format has a content_wrapper, essentially a template with a placeholder for inserting the logging statements somewhere "in the middle". 
Fx for XML

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <root>
    # appended lines here
  </root>

=== Channels
The appenders can target different channels, such as a File, a Socket, Database or a Web Service etc.
